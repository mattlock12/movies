has anybody watched Idiocracy lately? Idk if there's a German word that means the opposite of "schadenfreude," but I think that's what you'd have to use to describe this movie. Feeling ashamed at something that makes you feel good

the central conceit is that "stupid" people have ruined the world and we get to laugh at them as they get their just desserts

obviously these people are reflections on the stupidity of the present moment

and I can get behind some of it -- the meanness of ignorance that echos bullies and bigots and homophobes (although the future is remarkably free of racism)

but the cultural stuff always rubs me a little wrong  

if this is the "stupid" world, one wonders what the "smart" world would be for the writers/director

fine wines? fancy restaurants? eloquent diction? book clubs where they discuss the literary greats?

in other words, all the stuff that signify people who are rich and/or went to college

in contrast to cultural products popular among people that are poor and did not go to college

there's a very clear conception here of what a "stupid" person likes, and who would be considering it stupid

which is very classist and more than a little racist

do people choose fast food over duck faux gras because they're stupid, or because it's what they can afford? Or because there were no cultural pressures to like foreign cuisine?

I used to like Arby's when I was younger. Does that mean I was "stupid" until I went to college?

are monster trucks for stupid people? But F1 is for the elite? What about horse racing?

and how about "inner city slang," which is the most obvious influence on the "stupid" lingo of the future (even though, to cover their asses, they say it's a combination of valley girl, hillbilly, and inner city slang)

what about "hillbilly" dialect for that matter

are people who grow up with a different manner of speaking somehow more stupid than the rest of us, who had our linguistic diversity hammered out by years of teaching us which words to use in "professional" settings?  

stupidity is displayed as trends in brand and cultural consumption, which ultimately led to the immiseration of the human race

as if "smart" people don't take pleasure in "stupid" things

as if corporatism is entirely the domain of stupid people, or is some predatory force that only the "adults in the room" can combat  

and not, in reality, a huge rapacious network comprised mostly of those "smart" people

most of whom got into college based entirely on circumstantial conditions of their upbringing, and not by any greater gifted intelligence  

there's no inequality in the future, no trillionaire CEOs forcing their workers to drink their own piss to meet deadlines

rather, the universal condition of every "stupid" human in the future mirrors the current material condition of poor people in the present day

so there you go: "smart" == rich; "smart" == possessed of the sorts of tastes that are instilled in people who go to college
